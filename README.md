# Graph-Gen-Replay

This repository contains my personal reimplementations of classic and state-of-the-art **Graph Generative Models**. The goal is to bridge the gap between paper theory and code implementations.

## Roadmap && Status
| Model | Paper | Status | Notes |
| :---  | :---  |  :---  |  :--- |
| **VGAE** | [Variational Graph Auto-Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07308) | In Progress | First model to implement |
| **GraphRNN** | [GraphRNN: Generating Realistic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08773) | Todo | 

## Installation & Environment
- Python
